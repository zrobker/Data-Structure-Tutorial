# Python Data Structure Tutorial

Welcome to the Data Structure Tutorial.  In this tutorial we will be covering the following data structure types and learning how to implement them:

- [Stacks](1-stacks.md)
- [Sets](2-sets.md)
- [Trees](3-trees.md)

Each module will contain descriptions and examples.  At the end of each module, you will find a problem to solve on your own.  You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem first.
